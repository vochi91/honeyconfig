  # HONEYNET GENESIS
# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Intro Project)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1974b4f8-7332-4ebd-99c1-59d70491a0b4)

In this project, I created a small honeynet in Microsoft Azure ‚Äî a test environment designed to attract and monitor attacks. I connected different log sources (virtual machines, blob storage, active directory data etc) to my Log Analytics workspace. This workspace then sends data to Microsoft Sentinel

The tools needed for our minihoneynet project will consist of:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (1st windows, 2nd attack windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- SQL Server
- Microsoft Entra ID

<details><summary>üîΩResource Group</summary>

The first thing we are going to do is create a resource group so that we have a folder that keeps all the related cloud stuff for a project‚Äîlike virtual machines, storage, and settings‚Äîorganized in one place.
1) Create a name for the resource group. We will call ours  "Honey-Files"
2) Choose a region where we will deploy our VMS, create our log analytic workspace, NSGS etc

<details><summary>üîΩ Linux Virtual Machine</summary>

Create  Ubuntu (Linux) Virtual Machine
1. Name the VM: (linux-vm).
2. Same Region, Resource Group, and VNet as windows-vm
3. We will use a username and password instead for authentication
   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f00074f-ba53-4036-85b8-854cb5cee22b)

<details><summary>üîΩ Network Security Group </summary>

- Our Network Security Group is the firewall or security gate of our virtual network. 
- It decides who is allowed in or ho gets bloackd when trying to conect to our virtual machine.
- We will open up the gates all the way, so anyone can cnnect out VMs.

  Inbound Rules
  - Inbound is all the traffic coming into our vms.
  - Inbond Rules will allow or block that traffic. If we dont allow traffic then our VMS will just sit there without keeping track of any activity or alerts to log.
 
    Step by Step Breakdown
    1) We will go to our windows vm and locate the network settings
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4cf4581-1f5b-452b-99da-d7fa693e65d2)

    2) Create a new inbound rule
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0beab45-bb75-4487-bddf-fd1e663e84b3)

      -  We will change the desintation port range from 8080 to * allowing inbound traffic from any port.
      -  We will change the priority to 100 which is the minimum. The lower the number the higher the priority will be compared to ther inbound rule that are already present.
      -  we will name the rule "DangerAllowAnyCustomAnyInbound"
      -  Keep everything else at default and press Add.
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d57aaf78-271a-4ea9-9917-15f9b3e3ee45)


Repeat the same exact process for Linux vm.

<details><summary>üîΩWindows Firewall</summary>

We are now going to RDP into our windows vm to turn off the firewall. This will make the environment even more insecure because our firewall blocks unauthorized network access.

Step 1: We will search Windows Remote Dextop Connection (RDP) and then log in with our IP address and the VM's login credentials
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae336a0-1387-4333-9bd0-7e0a1656dbda)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0505228d-3cd3-407b-81d2-ffffb65d74e4)

Step 2: search for Windows Firewall or "wf.msc" 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d885d045-5492-4737-8678-0e3aa64a9acc)

Step 3: Disable Firewall

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f88017-a2ca-4e84-97ef-1d2df3c7f6a1)

Step 4: Test Firewall vulnerability by using my windows vm to ping my linux vm.
Open command line on windows, type ping and then the ip address of linux.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e555d51-4245-4745-8aa7-09b0a42981aa)

Firewall is down now so other devices will be able to have access.

<details><summary>üîΩLog Analytics Workspace</summary>

We will be creating our Log Analytic Workspace or "LAW" (soc-surveillance). This is the nucleus of our honeynet project. It is like a giant cloud notebook that collects and organzies data so that we can detect and investigate suspiscious activity. This will be the location of all of our activities in active directory, virtual network, network security groups, and our SIEM (Sentinel) 

Step 1: search Log Analytic Workspace 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da7b451-be34-4d2d-9c03-20d6da3d0490)

Step 2: Create 
   1) We are using our same resource group "Honey-Files"
   2) We will call our LAW "soc-surveillance"
   3) Same region as Resource group and Virtual machines
   4) Review and Create

<details><summary>üîΩMicrosoft Sentinel</summary>



Microsoft Sentinel is our security control room, just like security cameras in a building, it watches every activity that is happening in our system. Through this SIEM we will turn our LAW into a security investigation platform by connecting the two.

Step 1: Create Sentinel
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b84e01e-9ffa-45c4-a775-a6c045800477)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/856bb8de-ed26-465b-916d-25685ad70b4d)

Step 2: Connect to LAW

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313cd8bb-6d7d-4168-8ac4-0fe3149e7365)

Step 3: Create a watchlist in Sentinel
- We will upload IP-related geodata as a reference point for Sentinel in the future to intelligently track more suspicious activity.
- This will help narrow down our search to a certain rgion, city if possible.

   1) Go to Sentinel and locate watchlist, then create new.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca264a15-f3c8-41a6-a15e-e4faf4ab9bbb)
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a2c862-6f79-4852-8bc1-8c844777680f)

   2) Upload and name geodata file.
      - Keep name and alias the same.
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3d75cec-b45e-485c-844d-432e81f4bc30)
        - Upload the gile. Keep everything else default. The only thing you ltar is changing searchkey to network
          ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2b98955-39dc-440e-adb8-c378cf435867)

   3) Go to Log Analytics Workspace and check that Sentinel has received and loaded our geo-data correctly
      - Go to LAW and then locate the log section
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef54adb6-ab5d-467e-9d8e-595702333dcd)
      - Make sure KQL mode is on an type in _GetWatchlist("geoip"). If it worked, we‚Äôll see a table appear with columns like country, IP ranges, etc
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28a80b80-eec5-4a4e-82f2-8d0323589cb6)

<details><summary>üîΩMicrosoft Defender for Cloud</summary>

Defender for Cloud is the security guard, the line of defense for our cloud infrastructure and all the resources(virtual machine, databases, files etc) in it.
 - Cloud scans for intruders
 - Cloud alerts if enemies are nearby
 - Cloud tells you what walls to harden and reinforce.

We will take logs from our security groups and vms, injesting them into our LAW.

Step 1: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Log Analytics Workspace
- Open up MDC on Azure and then go to environment settings.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/798cebac-029d-47a2-b28f-12267664fdcc)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eadd47b-ec95-4891-9fcf-98b96c6d5edc)
- Scroll down and expand the subscription until we see our LAW, and then edit settings.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e6a7c7-b9f4-4a64-ac5e-b0ba9ab77084)
- Go to defender plans to turn on servers, and sql servers to allow us to collect logs from vms and SQL server.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfefaf31-b224-4cbb-acb8-66154fdb05bd)
- Go to data collection and cehck "All Events" so we can collect all events from Windows Security Log
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10370b2e-6a57-425f-a702-df773b6ca0d7)

  Step 2: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud for Azure Subcription, this ensures MDC is protecting our entire cloud environment ‚Äî not just the VMs.
  - Go back to Environment settings, go to Subscription this time and edit settings.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f0ecc6d-fb3f-4739-a575-ce0b7f633eec)
  - Under Defender Plans, turn on protection for Servers, Key Vault, Storage, and Databse
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be3fa62-844c-468d-aaaf-7c4ae13fc76d)

Step 3: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Continuous Export in Environment Settings: this will export alerts to LAW for future KQL queries
- Under Continous Export, go to Log Analytics Workspace and permit all data to be exportd to LAW
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96f178a-8689-45cf-b884-ebca78a99b26)
  Scroll down and export config to our resource group "Honey-Files", and finally export to our our LAW and save everything.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbd40db-6ccd-41f5-99fe-1969f68fc0e5)

<details><summary>üîΩLogging and Monitoring</summary>

In this section we will be configure logging for all of our virtual machines (excluding attack vm) network security groups. It will be a different process for our virtual networks compared to other resources in Azure because our vms require agents to be installed and configured to enable logging.

Step 1: Create a storage account to store our NSG flow logs in.
   - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf14c742-1c8f-4bb8-bd18-a265047559c7)
   - We will name it "securityvault", using the same resource group and region that we have been using. Once done we review and create.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afd47338-2b1d-43bf-8f88-c6f1de0f26e4)

Step 2: Enable flow logs for NSG.
   - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc890a0-bc00-4097-a70c-8c65bca31de5)
   - Go to anyone of our vm's network security group (there should be one for each vm) and click nsg flow log.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61384461-b6e5-400d-9194-f24ec29fa585)
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53985fc1-902b-4762-91db-8f7e7837fd43)
     - Create a new flow log
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7365fa7-aa02-4339-990d-7d56f1df15d6)
     - Target resource will be for both network security groups, use the same LAW and storage account that we just created "securityvault"
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f657c0f-203a-4286-9681-131c270c7d0a)

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05888bf-e225-481a-936e-cca549a167dc)

Step 3: Configure Data Collection Rules for our VMs within Microsoft Sentinel

We will be setting up rules to collect important logs from your Virtual Machines (VMs) so that Microsoft Sentinel can monitor them.
Think of it like: "Hey Sentinel, here are the computers (VMs). I want you to keep an eye on these specific types of events (like login attempts or errors)."
These rules are called Data Collection Rules (DCRs).

- Go to sentinel and click on our LAW "soc-surveillance".
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398f7d30-99a3-451b-bbd3-f9ec3cfdd50d)
-Scroll down to Cintent Hub under Content Management
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e83ccf88-3720-450a-9b6c-5092d1dc1483)
- We will install monitoring agents for both of our virtual machines. 'Window Security Events" for windows vm and "Syslog" for linux.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22e5b4fd-be6a-455d-aefc-5129e1221917)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c192cac-8a4d-4adf-b473-171c930a1691)

<details><summary>üîΩMicrosoft Entra ID  and Azure Activity Log Ingestion</summary>

In this section we will continue to ingest log activity into our LAW, bringing them this time from our Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID)

Step 1: Create Diagnostic Settings to ingest Azure AD Logs on a Tenant Level(Administrator)
- Go to Microsoft Entra ID and create DIagnostic Settings (ds-audit-signin)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24865dad-bd24-45c0-b6c6-0547acade01c)
-Name the setting "ds-audit-signin", w ewill only need to enable the signin logs and audit logs. Send to LAW
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba68b50-49e8-4aa4-9c14-8a2a8ac63d73)
- Lets check our LAW to see if tables for "AuditLogs" and "SigninLogs" were created
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e70112f4-edfe-4024-bbab-138ff66f154a)

Step 2: Create Activity to Test the Logs: We're pretending to be a real admin doing admin stuff ‚Äî we will generate activity that should appear in the logs.

- Create a dummy user, username ‚Äúdummy_user‚Äù

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a6cc84a-b012-41f4-b82b-f1d8a1a52e3b)

- Delete user 
   -![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db9ddfa-c700-4d85-801d-9a55799fc612)

-This should generate log activity on LAW
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e392d78-7be0-43f8-96fb-8d565956fb75)


Step 3: We will zoom out to our entire cloud environment and monitor whats happening in Azure.

-  Configure Azure to send platform activity logs to your workspace, so you can query them with KQL. Go to Monitor>Activity LOG>Export Activity Log

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e367cb06-f0a4-4202-ae9b-0b0cc835ad07)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c15d7a-a363-4ea7-bd69-aa8993313244)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8db8a5f7-798f-4ccf-8ca6-f61bc9c69589)

- Create Diagnostic Settings (ds-azureactivity) and add to LAW

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3720865e-d037-4367-9478-0482944951bf)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732407b3-5d59-4bb5-971b-59d4add33212)

We have now created a pipeline where Azure activities (creating\deleting resource groups) can be ingested into our LAW. We will now generate logs.
- Create resource group "Scratch-Resource-Group" and "Critical-Infrastructure-Wastewater"

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c304a3f-5c0b-4199-9086-1bd74cb87f13)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fffc957e-7ac2-40ae-84a1-bbfaf65d4518)

- Delete both

<details><summary>üîΩBlob Storage</summary>

 Storage accounts hold sensitive data such as secrets, logs, reads and scripts. Attackers would love to go after these first so its important that we log the activity that goes on there (read, write, delete etc)

 Step 1: Configure storage account.

 - Got to our storage account and enable diagnostic settings for blob storage (ds-blob).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/228dc805-2dc3-4014-b2c3-d6cd94204922)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bff9ec6-d1f9-4539-8db8-974b79c3b158)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b5eb59-4d42-499b-9654-2c2eaa2d3956)


Step 2: Generate logs by uplaoding and deleting mock blob files'

- In the storage account go to container and upload a new file.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c88b1807-5d48-429b-8bb3-f2959e31f619)

- Delete file
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebaf11f8-f536-40c5-874d-947fcc160d23)


Step 3: Go to LAW and view blob logs "StorageBlobLogs"

check to see if LAW recorded deletion of the mock file. In real life situations it's important to keep track of unusual deletion of storage files.

- StorageBlobLogs | where OperationName == "DeleteBlob"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)

<details><summary>üîΩKey Vault</summary>
  
Key Vault contains secrets, passwords, and keys. It's pretty important to keep track of who is accessing those files, especially if the user doesn't have high priviledges.

Step 1: Configure Logging for Key Vault

- Go to key vault and create new with the same resource group and region.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3fa8af9-dd89-4629-926d-4d281cdde410)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0ca9d4-4673-4100-a49b-392fae58bef7)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06a97693-dc65-40fb-90f1-7f4b61508767)

- Enable Diagnostic setting for Key Vault "ds-keyvault" to send to LAW
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df2b8ee9-cebc-43d1-9053-1be6a5781f3d)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ab756fb-6dae-4b2f-a06f-e7e0f24e604f)



Step 2: Add a Test Secret. This will generate logs for accessing secrets and passwords in the key vault

- Go to our newly created key vault and create a new secret ‚ÄúTenant-Global-Admin-Password‚Äù and create new password

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f815fe2b-245b-45c0-abbe-63d889a33103)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed7650d-676a-4ced-9adb-f2dd8db655cc)


- Create a log by accessing newly created secret.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22cba163-e45d-4ef2-8f2d-35fa3a10409f)


Step 3: Go to LAW and view KeyVault logs "AzureDiagnostics"

 - Lets scan for logs that show that the secret was accessed in the key vault

   AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.KEYVAULT"
| where Resource == "AKVAULT100"
| where OperationName == "VaultGet"
| where ResultType == "Success"
| project ResourceProvider, Resource, OperationName, ResultType
